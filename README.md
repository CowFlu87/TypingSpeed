# Mechanical vs Membrane keyboard

## Introduction
In a simple experiment, I tried to verify if I am more accurate and quicker if typing by means of a mechanical keyboard
or a standard laptop membrane keyboard. 

## Method
I performded <b>20</b> tests for each keyboard and collected the Word Per Minute (WPM) and the Accuracy. 

## Main findings
Plotting the collected metrics in a scatter plot as in the figure, I can tell that I performed better with the membrare
keyboard. Even if I felt better typing with the mechanical keyboard due to its smoothess and softnees of its keys, these
peculiarities made me press the wrong letters more often. Probably, also gentle touches triggered the signals, resulting
in more incorrect words. When I saw that the letter I typed was wrong, I stopped, deleted and wrote again the word. 
This behaviour did not occurred with the membrane keyboard. Moreover, with this device, I was able to top 100 WPM and 
to reach the astonishing accuracy of 97%.
